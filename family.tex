Our main theorem considers the following family of distributions:

\begin{description}
%    \item[$U_{n,k,t}^{-}$] Another distribution of interest is picking $k$ points uniformly from $\zeroone{n}$ and then removing points that are within distance $t$ of one another, we denote this $U_{n,k,t}^{-}$. 
%    \item[$\mathtt{Code}_{n,k,t}$] The set of all $2^k$ points where all points are distance $t$ from one another.  Note for all outcomes $X$ from this distribution $\Hfuzz(X) = \log k$.
    
    \item[$\mathtt{PCode}_{n, k, t, \gamma}$] The uniform distribution over all sets $X = \{x_i\}$ of size $2^k$ with the additional condition that $\Hfuzz(X) \ge \gamma$.  Some points are allowed to lie within distance $t$ as long as fewer than $2^{k-\gamma}$ lie within a single ball of radius $t$.
\end{description}

%Our proofs show the impossibility of constructing fuzzy extractors for the family of distributions $\mathcal{W}$ of $2^k$ random points sampled from $\zo^n$ (without replacement).  Unfortunately, there are distributions $W_Z$ for some values $Z$ that do not have fuzzy min-entropy so first show this family is statistically close to a family with fuzzy min-entropy.  We set notation to describe the two families of distributions:
