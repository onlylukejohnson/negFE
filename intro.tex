\section{Introduction}
We show a negative result for efficient fuzzy extractors for all distributions with fuzzy min entropy even when given a (quasi) polynomial advice string from an unbounded collaborator. 

We will compare to other works like \cite{fuller2016fuzzy,fuller2019continuous,fuller2020fuzzy}.
