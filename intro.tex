\section{Introduction}
Infromation reconciliation and privacy amplification are the two fundamental tasks for key derivation from noisy sources used in quantum key agreement, biometrics, and physically uncloneable functions. 
Fuzzy extractors and secure sketches. \todo{keep going}

\caption{The region of error rate $t/n$ ($x$-axis) and fuzzy entropy rate $\gamma/n$ (y-axis) pairs for which the two negative results apply.  The four curves are maximum fuzzy min-entropy, Theorem~\ref{thm:main theorem}, Theorem~\ref{thm:main theorem ss} with $\delta=.25$, and Theorem~\ref{thm:main theorem ss} with $\delta =0$.}

We show a negative result for efficient fuzzy extractors for all distributions with fuzzy min entropy even when given a (quasi) polynomial advice string from an unbounded collaborator. 

We will compare to other works like \cite{fuller2016fuzzy,fuller2019continuous,fuller2020fuzzy}.
